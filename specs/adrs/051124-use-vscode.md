Status: accepted
Date: 2024-05-11

## Context and Problem Statement
We need a specialized text editor for our team to write software and that eases challenges of collaboration. Having a standard code editor can help make code styles and development more consistent and streamlined.

## Considered Options
- VSCode
- Atom

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "VSCode" because it has a lot of helpful tools and extensions and can be easily standardized across team members.

### Positive Consequences
- Ability to use linting in project development
- Ability to use live share and live server functions in development
- Helpful IDE tools like syntax highlighting, auto-complete
- Many available extensions

### Negative Consequences
- VSCode uses a lot of resources which could lead to performance issues on different hardware
- Potential over-reliance on extensions in development
