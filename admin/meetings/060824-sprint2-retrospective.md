## Agenda

### Introduction
- **Meeting Purpose:** Assess our work as a team over the sprint
- **Focus:** What went well, opportunities for improvement

### Team Reflections
#### What Went Well
- Comments on PRs were helpful for making changes and improvements
- Our features aren’t very advanced, but the basic features are done well
- Everyone was able to complete their tasks before our review
- Tasks were split evenly between pairs

#### Areas to Improve
- Spacing out work more so changes aren’t as last-minute
- Communicating with leads and partners if you need help or are too busy
- Adding more documentation, particularly for users
